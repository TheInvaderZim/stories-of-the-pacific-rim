Except for the Avery Manor maps, which were also made by me in DungeonDraft: https://dungeondraft.net/ using assets sourced from CartographyAssets: https://cartographyassets.com/ from a variety of creators including:
  * PeaPu: https://cartographyassets.com/creator/peapu/
  * ValsToys: https://cartographyassets.com/creator/valstoys/
  * Gnome Factory: https://cartographyassets.com/creator/gnomefactory/
  * Tyger_purr: https://cartographyassets.com/creator/tyger_purr/

All art by MidJourney. Generative AI was used as an assistant on this project, though limited only to names and some (not all) rollable table entries. AI is a gift! And I only use it wisely.
